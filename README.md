## Social Media Tourism Analysis

This project analyzes social media data related to tourism and travel behavior, utilizing machine learning techniques to predict user engagement and product adoption.

### Dataset Overview

The dataset "Social-Media-Data-for-DSBA.csv" contains information about users' interactions with travel-related content on social media, including features such as user demographics, engagement metrics, and travel preferences.

### Work Done

1. Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Handled missing values and outliers
   - Performed feature engineering and encoding
   - Conducted univariate and bivariate analysis
   - Visualized key metrics and trends

2. Feature Selection:
   - Used correlation analysis and feature importance techniques to identify relevant features for modeling

3. Machine Learning Models:
   - Implemented and compared multiple classification models:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Decision Tree
     - Random Forest
   - Performed hyperparameter tuning using techniques such as GridSearchCV
   - Evaluated models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

4. Model Interpretation:
   - Analyzed feature importance to understand key factors influencing travel product adoption

5. Predictive Analysis:
   - Developed a model to predict whether a user will take a travel product based on their social media behavior and demographics

6. Insights:
   - Total likes on outstation check-ins given and yearly average views on the travel page have the highest correlation with daily average time spent on the page.
   - The majority of customers over 70% are not following the company’s page.
   - 26% of users made an outstation check-in 1 week ago, suggesting a lower propensity to travel for these users.
   - Many customers prefer beach and financial hub locations, followed by historical sites.
   - Approximately 90% of customers use mobile devices, with tablets being the preferred device.
   - The majority of people (84%) are not working.
   - The majority of customers (85%) have not taken the product.
   - The Random Forest model achieves the highest prediction accuracy of 96% for both mobile and laptop devices

7.  Recommendations:
   - Implement tailored marketing campaigns and travel suggestions based on user preferences and behavior, including preferred location categories and travel network ratings.
   - Develop strategies to increase user engagement on the company’s travel page, such as interactive features, personalized content, and gamification elements.
   - Leverage social media and influencer marketing to drive more likes, comments, and check-ins related to travel experiences.
   - Offer incentives or loyalty programs to encourage users to follow the company’s page and engage with its content.
   - Analyze the characteristics of highly engaged users and replicate successful strategies to improve overall engagement levels.
   - Develop mobile-friendly features and campaigns, given the higher usage of mobile devices.
   - Target customers who have not checked in during the last few weeks, as outstation check-in frequency is a key feature.
   - Focus marketing efforts on adults, as they play a critical role in buying decisions.
   - Digital advertisements should be targeted at specific groups of customers who have a high propensity to buy tickets to receive more return on investment.
   - Use the Random Forest model to predict future product purchases and optimize marketing strategies.
